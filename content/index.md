## About Me

Hi! I'm Elli.
I'm a [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) Ph.D. student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).
I received a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).

I'm advised by [Dr. Michael Ernst](https://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/), [Dr. Amy Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/), and [Dr. R. Ben Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/) at UW CSE's [PLSE](https://uwplse.org) and [LCI](https://www.computinged.uw.edu/) research groups.
My research focus is on using software engineering to help scientists write software more productively and with fewer bugs or errors.
I'm studying how scientists (biologists, geoscientists, etc.) write programs for their research to guide the questions: **how can software engineering support the needs and goals of scientists, how must software engineering be adapted for scientific research, and how should good software engineering be taught to scientists?**
If you're a scientist who writes any code for your research, please reach out!

I'm also very passionate about making computer science a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse field.
I'm dedicated to working to make computing a safe, supportive, and welcoming field for all, and especially for women, transgender and nonbinary people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.

In my free time, I love reading, traveling, hiking, biking, and playing and especially GMing tabletop role-playing games like D&D.
My favorite genres are fantasy, science fiction, and speculative fiction more broadly.
Some of my favorite authors include Christopher Ruocchio, Ursula K LeGuin, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Brandon Sanderson, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
Scroll down to see what I'm currently reading (assuming my Goodreads is up to date)!

If any of this seems interesting to you, I'd love to connect!
