## Hi! I'm Elli

I'm an incoming [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) Ph.D. student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).
My research area lies at the intersection of Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Computing Education.
I received a Bachelor's of Science in [Computer Science]((https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/)) from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).

I'm passionate about Computing Education, Programming Languages and Software Engineering, and more!
I'm especially interested in the programming systems and software engineering tools that learners, data scientists, scientists, and other non-computer scientists and end-user programmers use when interacting with computing, learning, programming, and software engineering.
I aspire to study and design programming systems that are approachable and understandable to all users and that empower people to safely, efficiently, and easily use computing and write programs that take full advantage of the computing technology available to them to achieve their goals.

I'm also very interested in how computing education, especially for non-computer scientists.
I'm interested in studying what skills are hard for new programmers to learn and how we as computing educators can build off of learners' prior knowledge and backgrounds to effectively teach computing topics and techniques relevant to each individual learner's goals.
I'm also curious how recent advances in software engineering technology may require computing educators to focus on aspects of computing other than writing code—for example: reading, understanding, and testing software.
I believe that this goal is synergistic with my research interests in programming languages and software engineering.

In my free time, I love reading, world building, traveling, biking, and playing and especially GMing TTRPGs.
My favorite genres are fantasy, science fiction, and speculative fiction more broadly.
Some of my favorite authors include Christopher Ruocchio, Ursula K LeGuin, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Brandon Sanderson, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
As of 8 June 2024, I am reading [The First Book of Swords](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16509.The_First_Book_of_Swords) by Fred Saberhagen.
<!-- I love Studio Ghibli films (especially *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Princess Mononoke*, and *The Boy and the Heron*), the Dune movies (and the books of course), *The Owl House*, *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*, *Avatar: The Last Airbender* (the animated show), and *The Legend of Korra*. -->
<!-- During my time at Northwestern, I've fallen in love with the city of Chicago (and especially biking the Lakefront Trail when it's warm out) and love exploring the city.
And I absolutely adore going to Greece and traveling around my family's beautiful homeland. -->

If any of this seems interesting to you, I'd love to connect!

<!-- ## Research interests

I'm most interested in research into building powerful and accessible tools that make it easier to for people to interact with computers and computation!

<!-- Going forward, I hope to continue working towards building tools that let people do computing more effectively and efficiently. -->
<!-- I would love to combine this passionate with my fascination for languages in the field of programming languages to help design programming languages that enable users to write easier, safer, less buggy, and more correct code! -->

<!-- My current work is focused on evolutionary computation in artificial life.
As a member of the [Xenobot Lab](https://www.xenobot.group), I'm investigating evolutionary algorithms and open-endedness in artificial intelligence and artificial life.
You can see some of my work on [my GitHub](https://www.github.com/ellifteria)!

I also work in the [Leonard Lab](https://www.leonard.northwestern.edu) where I  am developing an open-source software package for analyzing flow cytometry data, specifically for mammalian synthetic biology applications. -->
