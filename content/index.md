## Hello, world!

My name is Eleftheria.
I'm a Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Washington.
I do synthetic biology research at the [Seattle Hub for Synthetic Biology](https://alleninstitute.org/division/seattle-hub-for-synthetic-biology/).
I'm interested in the code that encodes the programs that cells and biological machines execute.
