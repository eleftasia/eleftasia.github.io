## `Hello, world!`

My name is Eleftheria.
I'm a PhD student studying at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington.
I do synthetic biology research at the [Seattle Hub for Synthetic Biology](https://alleninstitute.org/division/seattle-hub-for-synthetic-biology/).
I'm interested in the information stored in genomes—the code that encodes the programs that biological machines like cells execute.
