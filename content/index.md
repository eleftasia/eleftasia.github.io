## Hi! I'm Elli

My name is pronounced /'ɛli/; it's short for Eleftheria (Ελευθερία).
I use she/her/hers pronouns.

I'm an undergraduate student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) pursuing a BS in [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/).
I'll be graduating this June and starting a PhD program in the fall!

I'm broadly interested in human-computer interaction, computing education, creative and interactive coding, and developing programming interfaces that make it easier for people to write and understand programs.
Specifically, I want to work on (1) creating easy-to-use and easy-to-learn programming tools and interfaces that empower students to more easily and efficiently interact with and learn computing and (2) improving computing education ideas, methods, and resources, all with the goal of making computing more accessible for all skill levels and backgrounds.
<!-- I love teaching and aspire to a career teaching in academia after getting a PhD (which will come after I finish my undergrad of course). -->
<!-- I've been lucky to have had incredible teachers throughout my life who've supported me and encouraged me to learn and I hope to be able to be that person for others in the future! -->

I'm also a big proponent of [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), technological decentralization, and [solarpunk](https://www.re-des.org/a-solarpunk-manifesto/).
Outside of CS, I'm an avid fantasy and science fiction fan.
Some of my favorite authors include Ursula K LeGuin, Becky Chambers, and Adrian Tchaikovsky.
I love reading, biking, exploring new places, learning languages, writing, and TTRPGs!
While at Northwestern, I've fallen in love with the city of Chicago (especially the Lakefront Trail) and adore spending as much free time as possible wandering around it and discovering new parts of the city (when the weather is decent).

If any of this seems interesting to you, I'd love to connect!

<!-- ## Research interests

I'm most interested in research into building powerful and accessible tools that make it easier to for people to interact with computers and computation!

<!-- Going forward, I hope to continue working towards building tools that let people do computing more effectively and efficiently. -->
<!-- I would love to combine this passionate with my fascination for languages in the field of programming languages to help design programming languages that enable users to write easier, safer, less buggy, and more correct code! -->

<!-- My current work is focused on evolutionary computation in artificial life.
As a member of the [Xenobot Lab](https://www.xenobot.group), I'm investigating evolutionary algorithms and open-endedness in artificial intelligence and artificial life.
You can see some of my work on [my GitHub](https://www.github.com/ellifteria)!

I also work in the [Leonard Lab](https://www.leonard.northwestern.edu) where I  am developing an open-source software package for analyzing flow cytometry data, specifically for mammalian synthetic biology applications. -->
