## `Hello, world!`

My name is Elli!
I'm a PhD student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington.
I work on synthetic biology research as part of [the Pinglay Lab](https://pinglay-lab.com) at the [Seattle Hub for Synthetic Biology](https://alleninstitute.org/division/seattle-hub-for-synthetic-biology/).
