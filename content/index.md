## Hello, world!

My name is Eleftheria \(Elli\) Beres.
I'm a Computer Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Washington.
I'm fascinated by biology at the molecular and cellular level, where, biology looks a lot like a bunch of little machines each executing their own, mechanistic, molecular program.
Almost like a lot of miniature computer programs!
