## Hi! I'm Elli

I'm an undergraduate student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) studying [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/).
I'm also starting a Ph.D. in CS next year at... I'm not sure yet!
Check back in April to find out.

I'm passionate about Computing Education, Programming Languages and Software Engineering, and more!
I'm especially interested in the programming systems—programming languages, IDES, etc.—that learners, data scientists, scientists, and other non-computer scientists and end-user programmers use when interacting with computing, learning, programming, and software engineering.
I aspire to study and design programming systems that empower users to interact with computing and write programs, that empower learners to understand computing and feel confident in their ability to code, and that are approachable to new users.
I'm also very interested in how computing and computer science are taught, especially to non-computer scientists, and in how recent advances in software engineering technology may require computing educators to focus on aspects of computing other than writing code—for example: reading, understanding, and testing software.

Outside of research, I love reading, world building, traveling, biking, being outdoors, and playing and especially GMing TTRPGs.
My favorite genres are fantasy, science fiction, and speculative fiction more broadly.
Some of my favorite authors include Ursula K LeGuin, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Brandon Sanderson, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
I love Studio Ghibli films (especially *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind*, *Princess Mononoke*, and *The Boy and the Heron*), the Dune movies (and the books of course), *The Owl House*, *She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*, *Avatar: The Last Airbender* (the animated show), and *The Legend of Korra*.
During my time at Northwestern, I've fallen in love with the city of Chicago (and especially biking the Lakefront Trail when it's warm out) and love exploring the city.
And I absolutely adore going to Greece and traveling around my family's beautiful homeland.

If any of this seems interesting to you, I'd love to connect!

<!-- ## Research interests

I'm most interested in research into building powerful and accessible tools that make it easier to for people to interact with computers and computation!

<!-- Going forward, I hope to continue working towards building tools that let people do computing more effectively and efficiently. -->
<!-- I would love to combine this passionate with my fascination for languages in the field of programming languages to help design programming languages that enable users to write easier, safer, less buggy, and more correct code! -->

<!-- My current work is focused on evolutionary computation in artificial life.
As a member of the [Xenobot Lab](https://www.xenobot.group), I'm investigating evolutionary algorithms and open-endedness in artificial intelligence and artificial life.
You can see some of my work on [my GitHub](https://www.github.com/ellifteria)!

I also work in the [Leonard Lab](https://www.leonard.northwestern.edu) where I  am developing an open-source software package for analyzing flow cytometry data, specifically for mammalian synthetic biology applications. -->
