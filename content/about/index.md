## Hi! I'm Elli

I'm an third-year undergraduate student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) pursuing a BS in [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/).
Excitingly, I'll be graduating this June and (fingers crossed) starting a PhD program next fall!

I'm broadly interested in human-computer interaction, data analysis and visualization, and computer science education.
Specifically, I want to create (1) tools that empower individuals to more easily and efficiently interact with computer and (2) new and improved methods for promoting learning and understand in computer education science.
I love teaching and aspire to a career teaching in academia after getting a PhD (which will come after I finish my undergrad of course).
I've been lucky to have had incredible teachers throughout my life who've supported me and encouraged me to learn and I hope to be able to be that person for others in the future!

I'm also a big proponent of [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), [technological](https://redecentralize.org) [decentralization](https://medium.com/daia/decentralized-ai-manifesto-e79de7ea78b2), and [solarpunk](https://www.re-des.org/a-solarpunk-manifesto/).
Outside of CS, I'm an avid fantasy and science fiction fan.
Some of my favorite authors include Ursula K LeGuin, Becky Chambers, and Adrian Tchaikovsky.
I love reading, biking, exploring new places, learning languages, and—when I have the chance—writing and learning to do pixel art!
From my two years here at Northwestern so far, I've fallen in love with the city of Chicago (especially the Lakefront Trail) and adore spending as much free time as possible wandering around it and discovering new areas!

If any of what I've said seems interesting to you, I'd love to connect!

## Research interests

I'm most interested in research into building powerful and accessible tools that make it easier to for people to interact with computers and computation!

So far, that has mostly been in various aspects of computational science.
I've passionately built tools to allow biological scientists to more easier and efficiently analyze large batches of data and some of the first tools in the unexplored areas of evolutionary robotics!

<!-- Going forward, I hope to continue working towards building tools that let people do computing more effectively and efficiently. -->
<!-- I would love to combine this passionate with my fascination for languages in the field of programming languages to help design programming languages that enable users to write easier, safer, less buggy, and more correct code! -->

My current work is focused on evolutionary computation in artificial life.
As a member of the [Xenobot Lab](https://www.xenobot.group), I'm investigating evolutionary algorithms and open-endedness in artificial intelligence and artificial life.
You can see some of my work on [my GitHub](https://www.github.com/ellifteria)!

I also work in the [Leonard Lab](https://www.leonard.northwestern.edu) where I  am developing an open-source software package for analyzing flow cytometry data, specifically for mammalian synthetic biology applications.
