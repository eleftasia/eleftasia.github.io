## About me

Hi! I'm Elli.
I'm a [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) Ph.D. student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).
Before coming to UW, I received a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).

In addition to my research, I'm very passionate about making computer science a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse field.
I'm dedicated to working to make computing a safe, supportive, and welcoming field for all, and especially for women, transgender and nonbinary people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.

In my free time, I love reading, boxing, working out, traveling, hiking, biking, and playing and especially GMing tabletop role-playing games like D&D.
My favorite genres are fantasy, science fiction, and speculative fiction more broadly.
Some of my favorite authors include Christopher Ruocchio, Ursula K LeGuin, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Brandon Sanderson, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
