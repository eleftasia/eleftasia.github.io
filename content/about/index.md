## About me

Hi! I'm Eleftheria but I go by Elli!
And I use she/her/hers pronouns.

I'm a [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) PhD student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).
Before coming to UW, I received a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).

In addition to my research, I'm very passionate about making computing and science more equitable, inclusive, and diverse fields.
I'm dedicated to working to make computing a safe, supportive, and welcoming field for all, and especially for women, transgender and nonbinary people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.
I'm the Secretary for the oSTEM chapter at UW.

In my free time, I love reading, playing soccer, weightlifting, traveling, hiking, biking, and photography!
My favorite genres are fantasy, science fiction, and speculative fiction more broadly.
Some of my favorite authors include Christopher Ruocchio, Ursula K LeGuin, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Brandon Sanderson, and J.R.R. Tolkien.
I love exploring Seattle and photographing the city!
