## Hi! I'm Elli

I'm an undergraduate student at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) pursuing a BS in [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/).
I'm passionate about artificial life, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computational science, and ethical computing.
I'm also a big proponent of [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), [technological](https://redecentralize.org) [decentralization](https://medium.com/daia/decentralized-ai-manifesto-e79de7ea78b2), and [solarpunk](https://www.re-des.org/a-solarpunk-manifesto/).

## Research interests

I'm passionate about machine learning and artificial intelligence.

My current work is focused on evolutionary computation in artificial life.
As a member of the [Xenobot Lab](https://www.xenobot.group), I'm investigating evolutionary algorithms and open-endedness in artificial intelligence and artificial life.
You can see some of my work on [my GitHub](https://www.github.com/ellifteria)!

I also work in the [Leonard Lab](https://www.leonard.northwestern.edu) where I  am developing an open-source software package for analyzing flow cytometry data, specifically for mammalian synthetic biology applications.
