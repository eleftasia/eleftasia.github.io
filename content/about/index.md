## About me

Hi! I'm Elli.
I'm a [Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) Ph.D. student at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu).
I received a Bachelor of Science in [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/).

I'm advised by [Dr. Michael Ernst](https://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/), [Dr. Amy Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/), and [Dr. R. Ben Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/) at UW CSE's [PLSE](https://uwplse.org) and [LCI](https://www.computinged.uw.edu/) research groups.
I research software engineering for scientists.
Check out more [here](/research)!

I'm also very passionate about making computer science a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse field.
I'm dedicated to working to make computing a safe, supportive, and welcoming field for all, and especially for women, transgender and nonbinary people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.

In my free time, I love reading, traveling, hiking, biking, and playing and especially GMing tabletop role-playing games like D&D.
My favorite genres are fantasy, science fiction, and speculative fiction more broadly.
Some of my favorite authors include Christopher Ruocchio, Ursula K LeGuin, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Brandon Sanderson, and J.R.R. Tolkien.

If any of this seems interesting to you, I'd love to connectâ€”feel free to reach out!
