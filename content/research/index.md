## Previous research affiliations

Before starting my PhD at UW, I did research in the [Leonard Lab](https://www.leonard.northwestern.edu/) at the [Center for Synthetic Biology](https://syntheticbiology.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University.
I worked with Dr. Hailey Edelstein on characterizing synthetic transcription factors.
I was also part of the [Xenobot Group](https://www.xenobot.group/) Northwestern's [Center for Robotics and Biosystems](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/) where I worked on simulations of growing rigid body robots.
