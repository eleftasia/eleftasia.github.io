## My research

I'm advised by [Dr. Michael Ernst](https://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/), [Dr. Amy Ko](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/), and [Dr. R. Ben Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/) at UW CSE's [PLSE](https://uwplse.org) and [LCI](https://www.computinged.uw.edu/) research groups.
My research focus is on using software engineering to help scientists write software more productively and with fewer bugs or errors.
I'm studying how scientists (biologists, geoscientists, etc.) write programs for their research to guide the questions: **how can software engineering support the needs and goals of scientists, how must software engineering be adapted for scientific research, and how should good software engineering be taught to scientists?**
