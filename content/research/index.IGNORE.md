## My research

I do synthetic biology research in the [lab of  Dr. Sudarshan Pinglay](https://www.pinglay-lab.com/) at the [Seattle Hub for Synthetic biology](https://alleninstitute.org/division/seattle-hub-for-synthetic-biology/) and computing education research with [Dr. R. Benjamin Shapiro](https://benshapi.ro/).

I also work on the [yEvo Mutation Browser](https://yevo.org/mutation-browser/) with the [Dunham Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/dunhamlab/).

## Previous research

Before starting my PhD at UW, I did research in the [Leonard Lab](https://www.leonard.northwestern.edu/) at the [Center for Synthetic Biology](https://syntheticbiology.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University.
I worked with Dr. Hailey Edelstein on characterizing synthetic transcription factors.

I was also part of the [Xenobot Group](https://www.xenobot.group/) Northwestern's [Center for Robotics and Biosystems](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/) where I worked on simulations of growing rigid body robots.
