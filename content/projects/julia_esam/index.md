In winter 2023, I took [ES_APPM 346 : Modeling and Computation in Science and Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/applied-math/academics/courses/descriptions/346.html).
We learned how to solve various methods for numerically solving ODES computationally and how they can model scientific and engineering concepts.

Unfortunately, we had to implement these in class in MATLAB.
Which is, I suppose, technically a programming language (this is a joke, I know that MATLAB is a programming language; it does have some good parts but overall, I dislike it).

Therefore, I reimplemented a couple of them in Julia.

I found that this dramatically sped up the algorithms—up to 300× in some cases!
I also definitely improved my programming skills and my Julia knowledge in particular during this project.

You can see a couple of these implementations [here](https://github.com/ellifteria/HodgkinHuxley.jl) and [here](https://github.com/ellifteria/TilapiaSIP.jl)!
