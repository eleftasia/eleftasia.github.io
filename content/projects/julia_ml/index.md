In spring 2023, I took [COMP_SCI 349: Machine Learning](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/academics/courses/descriptions/349.html).
In this course, we learned about several machine learning algorithms.

I really enjoyed learning about these algorithms from a theoretical perspective.
However, I found myself a bit disappointed that we didn't actually implement them in practice at all.
So, I decided to implement a couple on my own!

Specifically, I chose to implement, completely from scratch, a [binary tree classifier](https://github.com/ellifteria/BinaryDecisionTree.jl) and a [neural network](https://github.com/ellifteria/PerceptronNetwork.jl) in Julia.

I definitely learned a lot from doing so.
While I am fascinated and passionate about machine learning, I'm not very interested in just parameter tuning pre-made ML models manually or just running bigger and bigger models on more and more expensive computers that use up more and more resources and contribute more and more to the current climate crisis and inequality.
Instead, I'm passionate about how we can build new types of ML and come up with new algorithms that will enable machines to learn new behaviors, become more lifelike, interact better with humans, and run far more efficiently and sustainably.
Because of these, actually implementing these theoretical algorithms helped me understand how they really work in the real world.
It was just the right mix between theory and practice for me.
