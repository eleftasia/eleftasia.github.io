title: Dengue Zika RNA Seq Analysis
date: 2022-12-11
summary: RNA Seq analysis of Zika and Dengue virus infections. Final project for BMD_ENG 311 @ NU. Dec 2023.
---

In my final project for BMD_ENG 311: Computational Genomics, I analyzed RNAseq data to determine differentially expressed genes in Dengue and Zika virus infection.
The goal was to identify upregulated and downregulated RNAs in each infections profile.

The data and analysis done here was based on work done by [Kamini Singh et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35891396/)

The codebase and analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/ellifteria/dengue-zika-genomic-analysis).
