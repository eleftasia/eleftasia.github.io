	abstract = {Experimental evolution is a powerful method for studying the relationship between genotype and phenotype by observing how populations genetically adapt to controlled selective pressures. In educational settings, this approach also offers a dynamic way for students to engage with molecular genetics. One such educational effort, known as {\textquotedblleft}yEvo{\textquotedblright} (yeast evolution), introduces experimental evolution into high school classrooms, allowing students to evolve the baker{\textquoteright}s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under various stressors and investigate the resulting de novo genetic changes. While the hands-on experiments have been successful in fostering student interest and understanding of evolution, the downstream data analysis{\textemdash}interpreting whole-genome sequencing results of evolved yeast compared to the ancestor{\textemdash}remains a challenge. Students often struggle to grasp the significance of their mutated genes and lack the broader context to determine which mutations are most phenotypically relevant. To address these issues, we developed the yEvo Mutation Browser, an intuitive web tool designed to assist students and researchers alike in visualizing and contextualizing genome sequencing data. Developed using R Shiny, this tool features an interactive chromosome map displaying mutated genes, graphs categorizing mutation types, and a gene viewer illustrating specific mutation sites within genes. The app also features an option for non-yEvo-affiliated users to upload their own experimental evolution or genetic screen datasets and compare them with all yEvo data collected since 2018. The yEvo Mutation Browser streamlines data interpretation, helping students understand how organisms employ diverse genetic strategies to adapt to environmental stress. In the future, this framework could be adapted for use with other model organisms, offering a valuable resource for both genetics research and education.Summary The yEvo project, a collaboration between high school classrooms and university yeast research laboratories, allows students to experimentally evolve yeast and observe the effects of mutations and natural selection in real time. The yEvo Mutation Browser, a new web tool, enables users to visualize the evolved strains{\textquoteright} mutations at both the gene and chromosome levels, compare their findings with other classrooms using various conditions, and even upload their own data, benefiting both educators and the yeast genetics community.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.National Institute of General Medical Sciences, R25GM154336National Science Foundation, 1817816National Human Genome Research Institute, https://ror.org/00baak391, T32 HG000035},
